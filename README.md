# Chipotle-Bot
An Android bot I coded which took advantage of Chipotle's Freeting Program.

## Freeting
In May / June of 2019 Chipotle started the Freeting Program, where every time the NBA announcers said the word "Free", they would post a tweet like the following:

```
The announcers just said FREE. The next 500 people to text FREEFZZPP to 888222 will score a free burrito.
```

## Chipotle-Bot Functionality

If the app is running in the background, it adds a listener to your notification bar on your phone for tweets from Chipotle. After getting the tweeted string, it extracts the code and automatically texts it to 888222. Since programs are faster than humans at texting, this meant a guaranteed FREE burrito everytime.

## Installation

To install, open this repository in Android Studio and download to your Android Phone. Make sure to turn your chiptole twitter notifications on and give this program the required permissions in your phone's settings.

#### Disclaimer:

This bot violates the terms and services of the Chiptole Freeting program, so obviously this program was never used and was just for fun ;)
